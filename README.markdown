This is a fork of the [taxonomy repository at Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/taxonomy/), which makes it possible to create a local database containing the content of the NCBI taxonomy.
The database can then be queried for names, ranks, and lineages. The present repository adds the functionality to create a Newick tree from a list of NCBI taxonomy identifiers.

It depends on [Michael Kuhn's version of the newick Python library](https://bitbucket.org/mkuhn/newick)
